# The workflow we want to analyse. By convention, the first stage should be
# the backlog / initial state, and the final stage should indicate the work
# is done.
#
# We map analytics names to JIRA status names. It's possible to collapse
# multiple JIRA statuses into a single workflow stage, as with `QA` below.
Workflow:
  Backlog:
    - "Release Backlog"
  Sprint Backlog:
    - "Sprint Backlog"    
  Development:
    - "In Development"
    - "Validation Failed"
  Review: "In Review"
  Done:
    - "Productization Backlog"
    - "In Productization"
    - Closed
    - Resolved
    - Done

# What outputs to produce. These are all optional. If an option isn't set
# the relevant metric will not be produced.

Output:

  # CSV files with raw data for input to other tools or further analysis in a spreadsheet
  # If you use .json or .xlsx as the extension, you can get JSON data files or Excel
  # spreadsheets instead
